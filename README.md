## AirBnB Clone Project

## UI/UX Design Planning

### ðŸŽ¯ Design Goals
The goal of the UI/UX design for this Airbnb-clone is to create a simple, intuitive, and visually appealing booking experience. The design should:
- Be **responsive** across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).  
- Offer a **clear and consistent navigation flow** from browsing properties to checkout.  
- Emphasize **visual hierarchy** (images first, then details, then actions).  
- Provide **minimal friction** for users to complete a booking.  
- Ensure **accessibility** (readable text, contrast, keyboard navigation).  

### âœ¨ Key Features
- **Property Listings Page** with filtering, sorting, and quick previews.  
- **Detailed Property View** showing images, descriptions, amenities, pricing, and availability.  
- **Checkout Page** with a simplified booking flow (guest info, dates, payment summary).  
- **Navigation & Header** for easy access to core sections.  
- **Responsive Layout** to ensure usability across devices.
